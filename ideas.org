Add data extraction functionality!

Looking good so far.

currently midway through adding a simple user system

* <2025-03-04 Tue>

Goals with this app:
- keep it simple, use the most highly supported tools
- ts frontend
  - use a message broker to hit different workers
  - have R and python workers that handle heavy dependencies
  - keep each set of dependencies in a nix env

Start small. Let's begin with just a ui that allows the user to upload
a document and have it get turned into docling markdown.
